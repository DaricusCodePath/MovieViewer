Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I encountered many issues while trying to build this application from the beginning. I do not have a MAC computer so I had to use a virtual machine to run OS El Capitan 10.11 so that I can use my Apple ID to download Xcode, Github desktop, and LiceCap. I am not familiar with OS and I am use to using Windows so there was a learning curve. I also am not use to Xcode so I had to learn that and go through the video and get the calculator to work. I have all of this running on a Surface Pro 3 so I am shocked that I even got this to working properly. This was a battle for me, especially considering the time constraints and the fact that I had to go around campus to work on the assignment and had finals week. I wish I had time to add more features before the due date but I will continue to update after the due date.
